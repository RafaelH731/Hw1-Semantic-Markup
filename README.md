# semantic-markup

This is my first homework for Full Stack Web Development

The goal for all the updates I made to the code were to meet assesibility requirements since a lot of the code was marked with non-semantic language and to combine elements in CSS.
HTML Changes
I added more detail to the <title> with the full name of the company
I edited in the <header> element tag lines 11-26
I edited in <nav> element tag lines 13-24
I edited in <section> element tag lines 28-50
I edited in <aside> element tag 51-73
I edited in <footer> element tag 74-79
All of the elments I added in before were <div> element tags
I added <alt> element to all images in the code and added their file names
Search Engine Optimization <img src> was incorrect and linked the correct image so it would load on the page

CSS Changes
I combined several class tags that were the same over different elements
I combined .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost
I combined .benefit-lead h3, .benefit-brand h3, .benefit-cost h3
I combined .benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img
I combined .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing
I combined .search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img
I combined .search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2, .social-media-marketing h2
All the combined changes above (lines 18-23) all had the same class attributes and I combined them to clean up and to not have so many repeating classes that did the same thing.
